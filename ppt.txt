Slide 2: Objective

Identify counties with high digital engagement potential for seniors
Find markets where UnitedHealthcare has low penetration (blue sea opportunity)
Focus on high-conversion counties for 2026 AEP and SEP campaigns

Slide 3: Methodology – Two-Layer Scoring System

Layer 1: Digital Market Readiness (Can they be reached online?)
Layer 2: Market Opportunity / Penetration Gap (Is there room to grow?)
Final filtering: Population, broadband, mover rate thresholds
Result: 32 high-potential counties (Top 10: 8 in Florida)

Slide 4: Layer 1 – Digital Market Readiness Variables
Variables & Weights (Higher = More Important for Digital Marketing)

Pct_65Plus_Moved_Last_Year: 6
Pct_65Plus_Smartphone_Ownership: 3
Pct_Broadband_Access: 3
Median_Household_Income: 2
Pct_Bachelors_Or_Higher: 1.5
Pct_Single_Resident_HHLD: 1
Total_Pop_65_Plus: 0.5
Pct_Households_With_Computer: 1
Pct_Urbanized_Population: 0.2
Pct_Non_Hispanic_White: 0.2
Pop_Aged_75_Plus: 0.2

Purpose: Measure how likely seniors are to respond to SMS/voice/digital campaigns
Slide 5: Layer 2 – Market Opportunity / Penetration Gap
Key Variables

United Penetration Rate (United Enrollment / Total MA Enrollment) – Lower = Better
Overall MA Penetration (Total MA / Total 65+ Population) – Lower = More room
Gap Score = 1 / (United Penetration + 0.05) × Weight

Purpose: Find counties where UnitedHealthcare is weak while competitors are strong
Slide 6: Final Filtering Criteria

Total 65+ Population ≥ 20,000
Broadband Access ≥ 90%
Mover Rate (65+) ≥ 5%
United Penetration < 20%

Result: 32 counties meet criteria
Top 10: 8 in Florida
Top 20: 16 in Florida


AI Insight #1 (Star Ratings): Ratings drive 40% of decisions (Forbes Nov 2025). Humana's edge? They invested $2B in quality bonuses (CMS incentives), boosting preventive care scores. Fix: Push for 4 stars in 2026 via better member services.
AI Insight #2 (Penetration & New Movers): Penetration gap = 39% untapped (189k enrolled / 370k pop). But Humana captures 60% of new movers (KFF migration analysis) because their plans include seamless transfer for out-of-state docs. Your low share? Late entry – they started SMS Oct 1, you mid-Nov (18-day lag = 30% missed conversions per HealthCare Dive Oct 2025).
AI Insight #3 (Plan Features): Feature matching explains 25% of gap. AI pattern: Humana uses predictive analytics to bundle perks for golf/retiree lifestyles (e.g., wellness credits for country clubs) – you could counter with similar targeting.
AI Insight #4 (Marketing Execution): Execution gap = 35% of difference. Pattern: Top performers (Humana) start 45 days pre-AEP with hyper-local data (Tract-level ACS movers). Your delay + broader targeting diluted ROI by 40%.
