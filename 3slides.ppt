Slide 1: Florida – The Lost Battlefield
Title: Florida Dominates Our Blue Sea Opportunities
Key Visual: Florida map with 16 red dots (top 20 counties – 80% in Florida)

Top 20 high-potential counties: 16 in Florida
Our current MA market share in Florida: ~9%
Leading competitor (Humana): ~42% in these counties
Insight: Florida is the #1 retirement migration state – we are significantly under-penetrated

Takeaway: This is our biggest market. We are losing ground fast.

Slide 2: Why We Are Behind – 4 Key Gaps
Title: Root Causes of Under-Performance

Overall Plan Rating Too Low
Our average CMS Star Rating: 3.8
Competitors (Humana/Aetna): 4.0+ on majority of plans
Impact: Plans with 4+ stars enroll 2.5× more members (KFF 2025)

Missing New Movers
~14,000 new 65+ movers to Palm Beach alone each year
Humana captures ~60% of new movers via early, targeted outreach
We are not systematically reaching them

Plan Benefits & Pricing Less Competitive
Competitors offer more $0-premium plans + higher OTC/dental allowances
Our benefits lag in key senior priorities (drug cost, dental/vision)

Marketing & Sales Execution Gap
Lower volume and less precise targeting (county-level vs. tract-level)
Competitors start 45 days earlier with AI-driven geo-fencing


Takeaway: These gaps explain the 10× enrollment difference in key counties.


Slide 3: How Competitors Win – And How We Close the Gap
Title: The AI-Driven Closed Loop (Humana CenterWell Model)
Visual: Triangle diagram – Marketing ↔ Sales ↔ Product, with AI in the center

Competitors use AI to connect the three teams in a real-time loop:
Marketing AI identifies new movers and high-potential leads
Sales AI provides personalized scripts and pain-point targeting
Product AI collects feedback to improve benefits and raise star ratings

Result: Faster, smarter, higher-conversion campaigns

Our Recommendation:
Build the same AI-powered closed loop

Marketing: AI-driven geo-fencing & mover targeting
Sales: AI-generated hot leads and scripts
Product: AI feedback loop to raise star ratings and optimize benefits
