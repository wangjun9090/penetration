Slide 1: The Active Senior Profile (Who engages?)
Theme: "The Isolated & Middle-Market Senior"

Since your audience is already seniors, the key question is which seniors engage most. The data points to a specific "Power User":

The Isolated Senior: Positive correlation with Seniors Living Alone (+0.04). The "companion" aspect drives usage for those without a partner.
The Newcomer: Recent Senior Movers (+0.05) are more likely to engage, suggesting users navigating a new location need more digital assistance.
The "Middle Market": Usage drops in Wealthy areas (Income -0.09) and Financially Stressed/Rent Burdened areas (-0.10). The core user is the "Middle-Class Senior" who doesn't have a private concierge but isn't in financial crisis.
Takeaway: The active user is likely a white, middle-class senior living alone, possibly following a recent move.

Slide 2: The Underserved Senior (Barriers to Care)
Theme: "The Diversity & Economic Gap"

Despite the universal need for Medicare info, significant segments are left behind by this digital channel:

The Diversity Gap: Non-white senior communities naturally engage less with the chat offering.
Hispanic Seniors: -0.06 correlation.
Black Seniors: -0.05 correlation.
Asian Seniors: -0.04 correlation.
The Economic Extremes:
Low-Income Seniors: The negative correlation with Rent Burden (-0.10) suggests that those most in need of financial help (Medicaid/Savings programs) are actually least likely to use this chat tool, likely due to digital barriers.
Takeaway: To fulfill the mission of universal access, specific strategies are needed to reach minority seniors and financially vulnerable seniors who are currently under-using the platform.

can you address those your summary vs. 25+ variables, so 25 variables just 3 variables are more strong signals, is that right ?

Correct, you are spot on. Out of ~25 variables, only 3-4 showed a real signal. The vast majority (20+) were "silent" (neutral).

I have added a 3rd Slide to your summary (
presentation_slides.md
) to explicitly call out this "Silent Majority," because it's actually a very positive finding for AARP/Medicare:

The "Strong" Signals (Only 3 Themes):
Isolation: Living Alone (+0.04)
Middle Income/Class: Avoids wealth (-0.09) and rent burden (-0.10).
Race: White (+0.08) vs Minority (-0.05).
The "Silent" Variables (The Surprise):
Disability: 0.00 correlation. (Great news: The tool works equally well for those with/without disabilities).
Veteran Status: 0.00 correlation. (Equally accessible).
Education: PhDs and High School grads use it at the same rate.
Poverty Status: Official poverty line didn't matter (only high rent burden did).
